Title:

Fix the trouble with the visibility of the "Взять в обработку" button.

Description:

The "Взять в обработку" button is appeared under the message with the order in the channel when the manager transfers the order to the "Новый" status in the admin telegram bot

Expected result:

The "Взять в обработку" button disappears when the status of the order changes and the manager takes the order for processing

Actual result:

The "Взять в обработку" button disappears and then reappears when the order status changes to "Новий"


Steps to reproduce:

Create a new order through the Shop bot

The new order that was just created in the previous step will automatically appear in the "QA Admin chanell" bot

Under the new order in the "QA Admin chanell" bot, click on the "Взять в обработку" button - this order will be displayed in the Admin bot

In the Admin bot, click on the "Изменить статус заказа" button, then click on the "Статус выполнения" button and select "Новый"

In the "QA Admin chanell" bot, the "Взять в обработку" button has appeared again


Reproducibility:

Always

Severity:

Major

Priority:

High

Workaround:

It is possible to bypass this bug only if you do not take the order at all
